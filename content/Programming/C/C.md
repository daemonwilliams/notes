**C** is one of the most foundational programming languages. Created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs (1972) to build Unix, it provides low-level access to memory with minimal runtime overhead.

---
#### Key Concepts
- **[[Pointers and Memory]]:** Direct memory addressing. The most powerful and dangerous feature.
- **[[Manual Memory Management]]:** `malloc`, `free`, and the [[Heap(s)]].
- **[[Struct(s) and Union(s)]]:** Defining custom data layouts.
- **[[The Preprocessor]]:** Macros (`#define`), includes, and conditional compilation.
- **[[glibc]]:** The GNU C Library (standard functions like `printf`, `malloc`).

#### Real-World Context
- **Linux Kernel:** Written almost entirely in C.
- **Embedded Systems:** C is dominant.
- **Drivers:** Hardware interaction requires C's pointer manipulation.
