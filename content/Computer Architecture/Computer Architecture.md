**Computer Architecture** is the bridge between software and hardware. It describes how high-level code is translated into electrical signals that a processor executes.

#### The Von Neumann Model
Modern computers are based on **Von Neumann Architecture**, which has three core components:
1.  [[Central Processing Unit(s) (CPU)]]
2.  Memory Unit (e.g. [[Random Access Memory (RAM)]])
3.  [[Input/Output (I/O)]] (e.g. keyboard/monitor)

**The Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle:**
1.  **Fetch:** Get the next instruction from RAM (via the Program Counter).
2.  **Decode:** Figure out what the instruction means (e.g., `ADD`, `MOV`).
3.  **Execute:** Perform the operation.

#### Key Concepts
1.  **[[Digital Logic]]:** Gates (AND, OR), Circuits, and Truth Tables.
2.  **[[Central Processing Unit(s) (CPU)]]:** Registers, Instruction Sets (ISA), and Pipelining.
3.  **[[Memory Hierarchy]]:** Why Cache misses kill performance. (Registers > L1 > L2 > RAM > Disk).
4.  **[[Assembly Language]]:** Human-readable machine code. (e.g. x86, ARM).
